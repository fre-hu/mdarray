# Multidimensional array for Rust

## Overview

The mdarray crate provides a multidimensional array for Rust. Its main target
is for numeric types, however generic types are supported as well. The purpose
is to provide a generic container type that is simple and flexible to use,
with interworking to other crates for e.g. BLAS/LAPACK functionality.

Here are the main features of mdarray:

- Dense array type, where the rank is known at compile time.
- Static or dynamic array dimensions, with optional stack allocation.
- Standard Rust mechanisms are used for e.g. indexing and iteration.
- Generic expressions for multidimensional iteration.

The design is inspired from other Rust crates (ndarray, nalgebra, bitvec, dfdx
and candle), the proposed C++ mdarray and mdspan types, and multidimensional
arrays in other languages.
